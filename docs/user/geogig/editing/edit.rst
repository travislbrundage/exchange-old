Edit Features
=================
Vector layers can be set up so that they're editable.  If you have permissions to edit a layer, the editing tools will be available in the map.
If a layer is a GeoGit layer, then you can work with the edit history as well.

Add a simple point feature to a layer
--------------------------------------
If a layer is editable, then the :guilabel:`Add Feature` button will be available next to the layer name.

Add a line to a layer
----------------------
A line layer consists of lines that represent features - such as roads, powerlines, and other features.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Add Feature` button.  The :guilabel:`Drawing Geometry` dialog will appear at the top of the screen.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_addfeaturebutton.png

Edit point geometry manually
-----------------------------
With point geometries, you can also manually edit the coordinates.  This is useful when you have the coordinates from another source (such as a report).

#. Click on the point feature on the map.  The feature info box will appear.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_featureinfobox.png

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Edit Attributes` button.  The :guilabel:`Edit Attributes` window will appear.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_editattribpopup.png

#. Click on the coordinates field to edit the point coordinates.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_editcoordinates.png

#. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button at the bottom of the form to save the attribute updates.


Edit polygon and line geometries
------------------------------------
Any existing features in an editable layer can be modified.  If it is a GeoGit layer, the history of all of the edits will be maintain to ensure the provenance of the data.

#. Click on the feature you want to edit.  The feature info box will appear.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_featureinfobox.png

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Edit Geometry` button.  The :guilabel:`Drawing Geometry` dialog will appear at the top of the screen.

   .. figure:: /_static/img/en_editgeompolygon.png
