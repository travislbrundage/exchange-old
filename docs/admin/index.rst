Actstream (Activity Stream)
---------------------------

Actions
^^^^^^^

Exchange uses Django Activity Stream, which creates a list of activities generated by the actions on your site, and allows you to quickly visualize who is performing what actions. An action is a description of an action that was performed (Verb) at some instance in time by some Actor on some optional Target that results in an Action Object getting created/updated/deleted.

Action events are categorized by four main components.

  * Actor - The user who performed the activity.
  * Verb - The verb phrase that identifies the action of the activity, such as created or deleted.
  * Action Object - The object linked to the action itself, such as a layer or a map.
  * Target - The object to which the activity was performed. Currently, Exchange is not using this component.

For example: admin (actor) uploaded (verb) a layer (object) 12 hours ago.

1. Click Actions in the Actstream menu on the Django site administration page.

  .. figure:: img/actstream.png

All of the actions that have taken place within Exchange will be listed, along with who performed it (actor), and what they did (verb). The target and whether or not the action is public is also listed, but they are not used at this time.

2. Click on an action to view more details.

  .. figure:: img/actions.png

Audit trail
-----------

The audit trail is intended to display all of the activities that happen within Exchange. It tracks who performed what actions, and when. Included is detailed information about the user, such as their IP, email address, full name and their user status.

To view the audit trail, click Audit events in the Audit trail menu on the Django site administration page.

  .. figure:: img/audit-trail.png

A list of all of the events that have occurred within Exchange will display. From here, administrators can filter everything for specific types of events, users, etc. using the search field. Simply type a term in the textbox, and click the Search button.

  .. figure:: img/audit-search.png

Audit trail is very similar to the Activity stream feature, but the primary difference is that with Audit trail, you are able to see when an event occurred, and from where. Activity stream tells you exactly what action has taken place.

Announcements
-------------

Administrators can create short messages for all Exchange users that will be placed at the top of their screen. Their importance level, determined by the originator, can range from general to critical, and can easily be scheduled for publication.

Create an announcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the green plus (+) Add button next to Announcements.

  .. figure:: img/announcements.png

2. Provide a title for your message, and select the level of importance for your message from the Level list. Your options are General, Warning and Critical, and should be determined by the nature of the announcement.

3. Type your full message in the Content textbox.

4. Select the checkboxes to determine whether or not you’d like your announcement to be seen site-wide, and/or for Exchange members only.

  .. figure:: img/announcement-top.png

5. Use the publish start and end options to create a display time limit for your message, and select a dismissal option from the menu.

  .. figure:: img/announcement-bottom.png

6. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button to create your announcement. To verify your announcement is correct, click the View on site button in the upper right corner.

3. Click the :guilabel:`Yes, I’m sure` button to verify your selection. You will be notified that your announcement was successfully deleted.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the green (+)  Add button in the Avatar menu on the Django administration page.

  .. figure:: img/avatar.png

A slug is the URL friendly version of the title. For example, with the group We Love Maps, the slug would be either We-Love-Maps or We_Love_Maps. When the URL for the group is created, it becomes something like this:

  ``https://exchange.boundlessgeo.io/groups/group/We-Love-Maps``
